# Overview
This project is structured using the Yii2 framework and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It is divided into two main components: the backend (dashboard) and the frontend (storefront). The backend handles administrative functions and background jobs, while the frontend focuses on user interactions, such as viewing car listings and managing purchases.
